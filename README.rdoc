== Week 3 of my 12 in 12 Challenge

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails) each week for 12 weeks.

This week I built a recipe box, with nested forms (each recipe has multiple ingredients and multiple steps), image uploading, and using HAML instead of ERB.
